                <p>
                    You can change your delivery preferences in Your Orders at any time after placing your order as long
                    as
                    the order hasn't entered the shipping process yet. For all deliveries, you consent to your order
                    being
                    left in a safe place.

                        Group My Items Into As Few Deliveries As Possible
                        Your order will be grouped into the fewest number of deliveries possible. This may mean that it
                        will
                        take longer to be shipped, depending on availability, but there'll only be one per-delivery
                        charge.
                        Please be aware that items whose availability is listed as 'Not Yet Released' or 'Back Ordered'
                        can
                        potentially delay deliveries with this option.

                        I want my items sooner. Ship them as soon as they become available (at additional cost)
                        Your items are shipped as they become available, beginning with those already in stock. You
                        should
                        choose this option if you want to receive your order quickly and the delivery may be delayed by
                        the
                        availability of a single item, for example. However, we'll charge you for the delivery of each
                        item
                        at
                        the rates quoted to you at the time you placed your order.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The number of deliveries we make for your order depends on:

                    Our fulfilment network
                    If your order has unrelated items such as a book, a computer and a cordless drill, they may be
                    shipped
                    separately, depending on where in our fulfilment network they're located.

                    Note: You won't be charged more for delivery than was originally quoted to you at the time you
                    placed
                    your order.
